                            <p>To create a dynamic, interactive responsive site using emerging technologies. A contemporary interpretion of the college visual identity whilst still embracing corporate guidelines. A content managed system providing access to an extensive number of site editors and content contributors.

                            <p> A complex structure of education, research, veterinary medicine hospitals, farms and an international business hub each competing for prominence on the site.</p>
                            <p>Defining, grouping and prioritizing information structure started from the top, workshopping with senior management to define key operational areas of the college. Once identified additional workshops were facilitated with each key areas to further define structure. The example below provides snap shot of information structure defined through the key area of Study.</p>

                            <p> I developed wireframes outlining individual element placement and functionality. The biggest challenge to create a consistent layout across numerous subsections with vastly different target audiences and subject matter.</p>

                            <p>Consulting with various member of each of team personas were developed to ascertain typical users and how they may access and navigate the site. Due to the broad subject nature the personas varied significantly. For example some typical users included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Potential undergraduate students interested in applying for a course. Typically these users are school and college leavers and their parents and guardians. </li>
                                <li>Potential postgraduate students. Typically science and veterinary graduates, PhDs and post-docs 
                                <li>The veterinary profession</li>
                                <li>Animal owners </li>
                                <li>Pharmaceutical, biotechnology, healthcare and health industry professionals 
                                <li>Research funders and influencers </li>

                            <h3> Rapid Prototyping </h3>
                            <p> Early in the project Orchard Content Management System, a Microsoft .Net open source platform was chosen as the basis for the content management system. Due the quick nature of developing pages and navigational structure within Orchard we created rapid prototypes demonstrating user movements and interactions based on the wireframes. In some cases such as for home and landing pages hi-fidelity screens were developed in Photoshop to present a more holistic view of how the project would look and feel. These rapid prototypes were used for early user testing and further approval from upper management.</p>
                            <h3> UI Design </h3>
                            <p> Being central in the development of the User Experience I had a strong idea of the direction that I wished to take the project visually.  Screenshots were developed within Photoshop based on the wireframes. A visual experience incorporating extra large screens down to mobile devices was parammount. The use of large background images on larger screens helped achieve this with CSS media queries removing these from smaller devices. The example below is an early iteration of the study landing page for large screen and small devices </p>
                            <img src="img/RVC-screen-early.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt ="RVC screenshot">
                            <h3>Front End Development</h3>
                            <p> I worked with a developer to create the Orchard Themes of the project. My role here was to use a Bootstrap parent theme and edit HTML and CSS providing a look and feel that reflected the mock that I had created in Photoshop.
                            <h3>Testing </h3>
                            <p>Being central to the design process it was imperative that testing was undertaken by an external company that was not involved in the design and build process. We provided user profiles developed from the personas for the company to recruit.  Two way mirrors,  eye tracking software, task analysis were used for the user testing.</p>
                            <p>During the testing process users were asked to choose from a list of words they would use to describe the site. The response displayed in the word map below was very positive. </p>

                            <h2> The Brief</h2>
                            <p>To create a bespoke content management system that administers and manages 35 distinct specialties and over 3300 specialists memberships. Additional to public access, the build required individual member access enabling updating of personal details and download printable PDF certificates of membership. Colleges automatically create and submit annual returns of college data for EBVS administrative and legal purposes.</p>
                            <h3>Project Proposal / Pitch </h3>
                            <p>This was a European Union project and due to its size and budget required it go to tender. I co-wrote the bid and pitched at the EBVS Annual General Meeting with over 70 delegates present.</p>
                            <h3> Information Architecture </h3>
                            <p>The Information Architecture from a public facing perspective was quite straight forward. A shallow navigation including:</p>

                            <p>One of the biggest challenges of  the IA was defining access and permissions for the various EBVS member types. With roles and access for standard diplomats, college representatives and EBVS administration varying significantly. After some early low fidility user testing it became apparent that the organisation itself was not clear of its exact type of membership roles as many of the process of the organization had previously been completed manually and roles and responsibilities were not documented. It was essential that membership types and access be defined before any start on the Dashboard Administration area.</p>
                            <img src="img/ebvs-membership.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="EBVS membership">
                            <p> From and administrative perspective we defined 3 types of user:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> <strong>Super User:</strong> Access to all areas of the dashboard</li>
                                <li> <strong>College Representative: </strong> Each College nominates a number of representatives that have access to the college pages. The College Representative is responsible for ensuring college information is up to date, adding new members, re-certifying members and submitting an annual return.</li>
                                <li> <strong>Diplomate: </strong>Every member of every college has access to their own page where they are able to keep personal details up to date including contact details and photographs.</li>

                            <p> Axure was ualised to create lo-fidility walk throughs. As the delegates of the organization spanned the European Union this was considered the best route to demonstrate the functionality of the product via a webinar. The notes functionality of Axure was enabled in the prototype for diplomats to make comments.  Changes were suggested in the webinar which were rapidly implemented in the prototype. This ensured that we had a functional prototype and a sign off from the organization in short timeframes.</p>

                            <img src="img/folium-screen.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="EBVS screenshot">
                            <p>Folium is an online tool that helps individuals to maximize their learning and track their progress towards professional competency. This is achieved through skills logging, tutor supported placement planning and reflection, and through recording of and analysis of learning experiences throughout the course. The reporting function allows the organisations to monitor student progress, to review course outcomes and support course development.</p>
                          	<h3>History</h3>
                          	<p>Folium in its original incarnation (Day One Skills Online) was developed in 2010 to address the issues of veterinary students achieving competence in their ‘Day One Skills’  by introducing an online logbook for students to record where and when they advance in a particular skill, enabling them to track their personal progress and to visually identify their ‘gaps’.
                          	</p>
                          	<p>Over the years functionality was added to the product that was not initially conceived. In 2016 requirements outweighed the usability of the product. I approached senior management and academics and presented a case for the original product to be retired and a new application to be built from the ground up taking into account functionally introduced over its life with possible future requirements not yet identified.
                          	</p>
                          	<h3> UX Design </h3>
                          	<h4> User Research </h4>
                          	<p>User research included interviews with students, tutors, course leaders and educational specialists. A wish list was gathered and the  functionality was prioritised for development. Top level system maps were created to display broader concepts of information flow and function along with user persona, and user walkthroughs. Four main user groups were identified: Tutees, Tutors, Group Leaders and Organisational.

							<h4>Prototypes </h4>

							<h4> User Testing </h4>
                            <p>A number of different user testing methods have been used to this point. Initially task scenarios and observations with individuals were used to gain qualitative insights into any usability issues. Large group (60 people) task scenario’s were also used to test application on various devices. (Need to find the name of the software) provide responses to various questions in a short space of time. User testing is ongoing</p>

                            <p>Folium is still in development. A working version of Folium can be viewed here: <a href="http://folium.rvc.ac.uk" target="_blank">http://folium.rvc.ac.uk </a>. This instance of Folium has been created for Veterinary Students at the Royal Veterinary College. It is accessable via a Google logon. The Placements and Reports section are currently in development. Placements to be released by the end of June.</p>
                            <p> Folium has been created to ensure that any skills/competency list from any course or institute can be uploaded into the application. Folium is to  be open sourced by the end of June 2017</p>

                            <h2> The Brief</h2>
                            <p>copywritenow is the portfolio site of Graham Tindall, a leading London based copywriter. This project entailed a complete rebranding, redevelopment of his portfolio.</p>
                            <h3>Logo Redesign</h3>
                            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                                <img src="img/CP-logo-old.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Copywritenow original logo">
                            </div>
                            <p>The original logo for copywritenow entailed a monkey at a typewriter. The concept based on the infinite monkey theorem that states a monkey hitting random keys on a keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text such as the complete works of William Shakespheare. Initial discussions with Graham determined he was keen to continue using this concept as the premise for his logo however he wished to give it a contemporary upgrade. He requested a black and white colour scheme reflecting ink on paper.</p>
                            <p> A number of alternative logo concepts were developed adhering to the infinate monkey theme. Alternatives were also presented using the metaphor of ink on paper.  This was well received by Graham who then suggested that another colour be included to add some contrast and further interested to the logo. </p>

                            <p> The final logo saw a shift from the infinate monkey theme but still retaining the ink on paper metaphore. A typographic font and the addition of a heavily contrasting red to the colour scheme led to the final logo. </p>

                            <p>The original information archecticure for copywrite now grouped information into a number of companies that Graham had worked for. After some discussion we decided grouping media types that Graham had worked with would better showcase his talent for each.

                            <p> A single page application approach was decided upon for the portfolio. Ink spilling provided a subtle transition between sections of the page. The metaphone was further expaned to create icons of standard representation for each of the media types. </p>

                            <h2>The Brief</h2>
                            <p>This original project started in 2009 and had a major software update and redevelopment in 2017. 
                            The original brief was to develop an international training course on the management of the health, reproduction, breeding and welfare of Asian elephants. After 7 successful years of delivery funding was secured to update the promotional site and the learning platform</p> 
                            <h3>Educational Design</h3>
                            <p>Working with world specialists I was required to put toghether pedagogically sound learning materials taking into account that for a majority of participants English would not be their first language. Because of language issues we decided to rely heavily on video and images content within the lessons. I was required to travel to Sri Lanka and Thailand to gather both video and image assets for lessons. </p>
                            <h3>Moodle Theme Design</h3>
                            <p>The original theme in Moodle was developed before responsive design was even considered. With an upgrade to the latest version of Moodle a new theme was deemed necessary to ensure that the materials could be viewed on all devices and platforms. I was required to design and develop this theme. I used the Bootstrap framework as the basis for the theme and was required to use my skills in HTML and SCSS throughout the development.</p>
                            <h3>UI Design for landing/registration page</h3>
                            <p>Taking aspects of the original information page and the registration form I designed and developed the landing/registration page.</p>
                            <p>Original images that we had taken in Sri Lanka and Thailand were used for the graphical elements of this page.</p>

                                <h3> Background</h3>
                                <p>The VetCompass Search Engine is a tool developed for veterinary researchers. It indexes millions of clinical records collected from primary practices and referral centres. Researchers use these records to create an evidence-base. The evidence is used by vets to improve the health and welfare of animals.
                                </p>
                                <h3> Design</h3>
                                <p>For this project, I was presented with a 3 page word document and asked to create a promotional/logon page for the project. I worked with project leads in refining content. A Single Page Application approach was used. Stock images were utalised for graphical elements. I created all iconic and vector elements on the page in Illustrator.</p>
